### Structure of an IBAN

1. **Country Code**: The first two characters are letters that represent the country where the bank account is held (e.g., "DE" for Germany, "FR" for France).
2. **Check Digits**: The next two digits are check digits used to validate the IBAN. They help to detect errors in the IBAN.
3. **Bank Code**: This part of the IBAN identifies the bank.
4. **Account Number**: The remaining part is the actual bank account number. Its length and format can vary by country.

### Example of an IBAN

For example, an IBAN for a bank account in Germany might look like this:
```
DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00
```

- **DE**: Country code for Germany
- **89**: Check digits
- **3704 0044**: Bank code
- **0532 0130 00**: Account number

### Purpose of an IBAN

1. **Standardization**: Provides a standard way to identify bank accounts across different countries, reducing errors in international transactions.
2. **Efficiency**: Facilitates faster and more efficient processing of cross-border payments.
3. **Accuracy**: Enhances the accuracy of payment processing by reducing the likelihood of errors in bank account numbers.

### Benefits of Using IBAN

- **Reduced Errors**: The check digits help to identify and reduce errors in the account number.
- **Simplifies International Payments**: Makes it easier for banks and customers to process international payments without confusion.
- **Increases Security**: Standardized format ensures all necessary information is included to identify the account correctly.

### Usage

When making an international transfer or receiving funds from abroad, you will often be required to provide your IBAN to ensure the funds are routed correctly to your bank account.

### Validation

Validating an IBAN involves several steps:
1. **Check the Length**: Each country has a specific length for its IBANs.
2. **Rearrange the IBAN**: Move the first four characters to the end.
3. **Convert Letters to Numbers**: Replace each letter in the rearranged IBAN with two digits.
4. **Perform Modulo Operation**: Calculate the remainder after dividing the numeric IBAN by 97. A valid IBAN should leave a remainder of 1.

### Example Validation

For the IBAN `DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00`:
1. **Rearrange**: `3704 0044 0532 0130 00DE89`
2. **Convert**: `370400440532013000131489`
3. **Modulo**: `370400440532013000131489 % 97 = 1`

The result is 1, so the IBAN is valid.
